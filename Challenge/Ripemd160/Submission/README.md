# RIPEMD-160 Yukon submission

This directory is the complete editable surface for the `ripemd160` track. A
submission must include:

- `bytecode.hex`: one line of lowercase EVM bytecode without a `0x` prefix;
- `Solution.lean`: `Challenge.Ripemd160.Benchmark.candidate`, proving
  `Challenge.Ripemd160.Correct bytecode` for the generated artifact.

Additional Lean modules may live here and be imported by `Solution.lean`.
Everything outside this directory is the protected specification, proof
support, evaluator, and workflow.

The lower-is-better score is clean-state gas summed over all 17 public vectors.
The same bytes must also return the correct result from the dirty state.
Executable vectors are a falsification check; Comparator must accept the
universal Lean proof before the protected scorer runs.
